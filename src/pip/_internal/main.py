# Do not run this directly! Running pip in-process is unsupported and
# unsafe.
#
# Also, the location of this function may change, so calling it directly
# is not portable across different pip versions.  If you have to call
# this function, and understand and accept the implications of doing so,
# the best approach is to use runpy as follows:
#
#     sys.argv = ["pip", your, args, here]
#     runpy.run_module("pip", run_name="__main__")
#
# Note that this will exit the process after running, unlike a direct
# call to main.
#
# This still has all of the issues with running pip in-process, but
# ensures that you donâ€™t rely on the (internal) name of the main
# function.
