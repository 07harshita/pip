This serves as an introduction to issue tracking in pip as well as
how to help triage reported issues.


Issue Tracker
*************

The `pip issue tracker <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues>`__ is hosted on
GitHub alongside the project.

Currently, the issue tracker is used for bugs, feature requests, and general
user support.

In the pip issue tracker, we make use of labels and milestones to organize and
track work.
