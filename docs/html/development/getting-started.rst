===============
Getting Started
===============

Weâ€™re pleased that you are interested in working on pip.

This document is meant to get you setup to work on pip and to act as a guide and
reference to the the development setup. If you face any issues during this
process, please `open an issue`_ about it on the issue tracker.

Development Environment
-----------------------

pip uses :pypi:`tox` for testing against multiple different Python environments
and ensuring reproducible environments for linting and building documentation.

For developing pip, you need to install ``tox`` on your system. Often, you can
just do ``python -m pip install tox`` to install and use it.

Running pip From Source Tree
----------------------------

To run the pip executable from your source tree during development, run pip
from the ``src`` directory:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python src/pip --version

Running Tests
-------------

pip uses the :pypi:`pytest` test framework, :pypi:`mock` and :pypi:`pretend`
for testing. These are automatically installed by tox for running the tests.

To run tests locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e py36

The example above runs tests against Python 3.6. You can also use other
versions like ``py27`` and ``pypy3``.

``tox`` has been configured to any additional arguments it is given to
``pytest``. This enables the use of pytest's `rich CLI`_. As an example, you
can select tests using the various ways that pytest provides:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Using file name
    $ tox -e py36 -- tests/functional/test_install.py
    $ # Using markers
    $ tox -e py36 -- -m unit
    $ # Using keywords
    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "install and not wheel"

Running pip's test suite requires supported version control tools (subversion,
bazaar, git, and mercurial) to be installed. If you are missing one of the VCS
tools, you can tell pip to skip those tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "not svn"
    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "not (svn or git)"

Running Linters
---------------

pip uses :pypi:`pre-commit` for managing linting of the codebase.
``pre-commit`` performs various checks on all files in pip and uses tools that
help follow a consistent code style within the codebase.

To use linters locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e lint

Building Documentation
----------------------

pip's documentation is built using :pypi:`Sphinx`. The documentation is written
in reStructuredText.

To build it locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e docs

The built documentation can be found in the ``docs/build`` folder.
