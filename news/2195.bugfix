pip install . is very slow in the presence of large directories in the source tree.
Typical cases are source control directories (.git, .svn etc) and test automation directries (.tox, .nox).
This diff excludes the common culprits from the copy to a temporary directory, speeding up pip install .
significantly in such cases.
