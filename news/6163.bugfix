The implicit default backend used for projects that provide a ``pyproject.toml``
file without explicitly specifying ``build-backend`` now behaves more like direct
execution of ``setup.py``, and hence should restore compatibility with projects
that were unable to be installed with ``pip`` 19.0. This raised the minimum
required version of ``setuptools`` for such builds to 40.8.0.
